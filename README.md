# FlexiPay

FlexiPay is a digital payment platform specifically designed to cater to the unique needs of non-profit organisations (NPOs) such as charities, sports clubs, and schools. Developed as part of a Master of Science in Software Development at Queenâ€™s University Belfast, this project aims to provide an accessible, efficient, and user-friendly digital payment system to help NPOs manage their finances better, especially in an increasingly cashless society spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Features

- **Intuitive User Interface**: Designed with the user in mind, ensuring ease of use without sacrificing functionality.
- **Stripe Integration**: Utilises Stripe as a payment gateway to ensure secure and reliable transactions.
- **Customisable Payment Links**: Allows organisations to create and manage payment links that are easy to distribute and track.
- **Client Management**: Provides a dashboard for NPOs to manage client information and payment histories effectively.
- **Robust Security Measures**: Incorporates advanced security protocols to protect sensitive data and financial transactions.

## Technologies

FlexiPay is built using the MERN stack:
- **MongoDB**: A document database used to store data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Additional technologies include:
- **Stripe API**: For handling payments and financial transactions securely.
- **Material-UI**: For designing a visually appealing and responsive front-end.
- **Mongoose**: To manage relationships between data, provide schema validation, and translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

## Installation

To run FlexiPay locally, you'll need to install Node.js and MongoDB on your machine. Clone the repository and follow these steps:

1. **Set up MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is running on your machine.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
 3. **Register for a Stripe Account
 4. **Set up a config.env file with a stripe secret and publishable key, a JWT Secret.
