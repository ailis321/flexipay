                                        No, there are no sign-up fees to start using FlexiPay. However, as we partner with Stripe to handle our payment processing, 
                                        each successful transaction will incur a small fee. You can find detailed information about these transaction fees on

                                    Signing up for FlexiPay is quick and straightforward, taking no more than 5 minutes. 
                                    You only need to provide some basic details such as your name, contact number, email, 
                                    business name, and password. After this initial signup, you will be redirected to 
                                    a Stripe-hosted onboarding page to enter further information. This includes your company 
                                    name and address, a bank account number and sort code for receiving payouts, 
                                    and other essential business details. Once this process is complete, 
                                    you will be directed back to FlexiPay, where you can start creating payment links and 
                                    adding clients to your client database.
